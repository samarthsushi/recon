I will always love you
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Oh, oh
Oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh, oh
Mm
