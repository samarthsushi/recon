Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh, yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make it shive last night?
Could I make it shive on the last night (last night?)
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
And I came to visit 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, know you got it (yeah)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, know you got it
